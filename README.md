## Introduction

In the company there are 2 categories of memberships for each client, an annualized subscription for member riders and a daily subscription or one ride payment for casual riders. The finance analyst determined that full members are more profitable for the company then the recommended step is to develop an effective marketing program targeting casual riders that could become members thus it is necessary a comparison of how casual riders and members use the bikes differently.

The comparison is going to use data of rides for the past 12 months, and beyond, of members and casual rides and the analysis done with MySQL and R with compelling graphics with Tableu of metrics in the data.
